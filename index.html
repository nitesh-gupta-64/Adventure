                Biking, also known as cycling, is a popular and versatile recreational activity that involves riding bicycles. 
                It has gained widespread appeal for its numerous benefits, including physical exercise, environmental friendliness, and a sense of freedom and exploration. 
                Biking can take various forms, from leisurely rides in the neighborhood to more intense mountain biking or long-distance road cycling.
                <br><br>
                One of the primary advantages of biking is its positive impact on physical health. 
                Regular cycling helps improve cardiovascular fitness, build muscle strength, and enhance overall stamina.

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport that allows individuals to experience the thrill of soaring through the skies while suspended from a lightweight, parachute-like wing. Participants, known as paragliders, launch from elevated locations such as hills or mountains and use the natural forces of wind and thermals to stay aloft.
                <br><br>
                The paraglider itself is a non-motorized, foot-launched aircraft consisting of a fabric wing and a harness for the pilot. The design of the wing allows for controlled flight, with the pilot using weight shifts and brake toggles to navigate and adjust altitude. Unlike traditional parachutes, paragliders are designed for sustained flight rather than rapid descent.
                <br><br>
                Paragliding offers a unique blend of adrenaline-pumping excitement and the serene beauty of panoramic views from above. It provides an intimate connection with nature, allowing enthusiasts to soar like birds and experience the sensation of free flight. The sport requires skill and training, as pilots must be knowledgeable about weather conditions, aerodynamics, and safety procedures.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a water sport that involves riding on the face of ocean waves using a specially designed board. Originating in ancient Polynesia, surfing has evolved into a popular recreational activity and competitive sport embraced by people around the world. Surfers paddle out to sea, wait for an approaching wave, and then ride it towards the shore, showcasing a unique blend of skill, balance, and connection with the ocean.
                <br><br>
                Key aspects of surfing include the surfboard, which varies in size and shape, and the act of catching and riding waves. Surfers use their bodies to balance on the board and maneuver through the dynamic movements of the waves. The sport requires an understanding of ocean conditions, wave patterns, and weather elements.
